- **Robot Exemption**: Robots are exempt by default but can be configured to pay
- Guests without enough silver will be blocked from passing
- All payments are deducted from the guest's inventory

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- Built using RimWorld's ThingComp system for maximum compatibility
- Uses Harmony patches for seamless integration with door mechanics
- XML patches automatically add components to all door types
- Inspired by Hospitality mod's proven UI patterns

### Compatibility
- **Requires**: Hospitality mod (uses its guest system)
- **Robot Mods**: Compatible with Misc. Robots++ and other robot mods
- **Door Mods**: Should work with most door-adding mods
- **RimWorld Version**: 1.5/1.6+

### Performance
- Lightweight implementation with minimal performance impact
- Only processes payment logic when guests interact with doors
- Efficient caching of exemption status

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Gizmo not appearing**: Make sure doors are selected and the mod is enabled
- **Guests not paying**: Check that they have silver in their inventory
- **Exemptions not working**: Verify the pawn type and exemption settings in door config
- **Robots being charged**: Check "Exempt Robots" checkbox in door configuration window
- **Silver not dropping**: Payments appear as physical silver near the door after successful payment
- **Window not opening**: Ensure you're clicking the "Paid Door" gizmo button when doors are selected
